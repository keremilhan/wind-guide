# ðŸ’¨ Keeping our riders out of the wind

### Project description
As a riders-first company, we want to make each ride for our riders as effortless as possible. That's why we've already provided them with fancy cargo bikes, a great mobile app, and a good cup of coffee to start their ride. But we don't want to stop there, we're constantly looking for areas to improve their experience. After talking to several riders, we found out that there's one thing in particular that riders hate: cycling against the wind.

Unfortunately for them, we won't be able to stop the wind. What we can do, is provide them with the information regarding their route and wind conditions so they know what to expect. And that's exactly the goal of this project.

### Requirements
The goal is to create a full-stack application to visualize routing data (stops and route) and enhance this visualization by incorporating real-time environmental data to indicate headwind or tailwind conditions along the route.
