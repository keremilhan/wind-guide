### Note on Backend Server Response Time

Please note that if you use the production app, the server is hosted on a free service, which causes it to spin down during periods of inactivity. As a result, the first request may experience a delay of up to 60 seconds as the server wakes up. Subsequent requests should be processed more quickly. This does not apply when running the backend server locally on `localhost`.
